可以在淘宝的机器上面编译的kcov


Kcov is a code coverage tester based on Bcov (http://bcov.sf.net).

Kcov, like Bcov, uses DWARF debugging information to make it possible
to collect coverage information without special compiler switches.

Simple usage:

   kcov /path/to/outdir executable [args for the executable]

/path/to/outdir will contain lcov-style HTML output generated
continously while the application runs.

kcov is written by Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com> and more
